# USER INTERFACE
As of late , websites have been pushing towards user friendly interface. This enables more users to spend more time on the website. I have decide to go on this approach by pampering user with a larch search box , followed by 3 category choices for their movie preference. 

As a developer, we need to be inclusive of all age groups and thus having a user friendly interface with simple design is the direction that I took.

# FEATURES
Movies will comprise of different search filters. I have decide to include 3 particular filter categories:
#  "UPCOMING"
>This enables the user to browse through upcoming movies which might interest them.

# "POPULAR"
>Users are able to browse which of the movies people have been watching and the current trends of late.

# "TOP RATED"
>Movies which are deemed as a 'must watch' regardless of the current time and even age.

# SEARCHBOX
>The staple which is embedded into all search application to make search easier.

# Upcoming features to implement
Good thing about using this api is there are plenty of data information available for developers to play with. Future updates, I will try to focus on more filters and sorts based on the data being returned.
